# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a scalable, production-ready real-time chat system capable of handling millions of concurrent users. The system will be built using NestJS with a monorepo architecture, implementing CQRS patterns, WebSocket communication, and leveraging multiple data stores for optimal performance and scalability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication and Authorization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to securely authenticate and maintain my session across different connection types, so that I can access the chat system reliably.
