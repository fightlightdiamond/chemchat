# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves investigating the current codebase to identify and fix issues with commented-out modules in src/app.module.ts, ensuring all modules work correctly, and creating comprehensive Swagger API documentation for testing purposes. The goal is to have a fully functional application with all modules enabled and properly documented APIs.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all modules in the application to be functional and enabled, so that the complete feature set is available for use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN investigating each commented module THEN the system SHALL identify specific issues preventing module activation
2. WHEN fixing module dependencies THEN the system SHALL resolve import errors, missing services, and configuration issues
3. WHEN enabling modules THEN the system SHALL ensure no runtime errors occur during application startup
4. IF a module has external dependencies THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation on setup requirements

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive Swagger documentation for all APIs, so that I can easily test and understand the available endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the Swagger UI THEN the system SHALL display all available API endpoints with proper documentation
2. WHEN viewing API documentation THEN each endpoint SHALL include request/response schemas, parameter descriptions, and example values
3. WHEN testing APIs through Swagger THEN the system SHALL provide working examples that can be executed directly
4. WHEN documenting DTOs THEN the system SHALL include validation rules and field descriptions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and validation, so that the APIs provide meaningful feedback for debugging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests fail THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses with clear messages
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific field-level error information
3. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL return appropriate 401/403 status codes with clear messages
4. WHEN rate limiting is exceeded THEN the system SHALL return 429 status with retry information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all modules to have consistent patterns and best practices, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows NestJS conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing module structure THEN each module SHALL follow consistent patterns for controllers, services, and DTOs
2. WHEN implementing dependency injection THEN the system SHALL use proper NestJS decorators and patterns
3. WHEN handling async operations THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and timeout management
4. WHEN using external services THEN the system SHALL implement proper connection management and circuit breakers
