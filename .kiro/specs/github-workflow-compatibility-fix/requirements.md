# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses compatibility issues between the existing GitHub workflows (CI/CD and security) and the current ChemChat codebase. The workflows are well-designed but have several mismatches with package manager configurations, missing scripts, version inconsistencies, and dependency issues that prevent them from running successfully.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI pipeline to run successfully without script or dependency errors, so that I can have confidence in automated testing and builds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CI workflow runs THEN all package.json scripts referenced in the workflow SHALL exist and execute successfully
2. WHEN the CI workflow installs dependencies THEN it SHALL use the correct package manager (npm) consistently throughout all jobs
3. WHEN the CI workflow runs database operations THEN the migrate:reset and db:seed scripts SHALL be available and functional
4. WHEN the CI workflow runs tests THEN all test configurations SHALL be properly set up with correct paths and coverage settings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent Node.js versions across all environments, so that builds are reproducible and don't fail due to version mismatches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Docker image is built THEN it SHALL use the same Node.js version as specified in the GitHub workflows
2. WHEN the CI workflow runs THEN the Node.js version SHALL match the Dockerfile base image version
3. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN they SHALL be compatible with the specified Node.js version

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want the security scanning workflows to run without package manager conflicts, so that vulnerability detection is reliable and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the security workflow runs dependency scans THEN it SHALL use npm instead of npm for consistency
2. WHEN the security workflow installs dependencies THEN it SHALL use the same lockfile and installation method as other workflows
3. WHEN security scans complete THEN they SHALL generate proper reports without installation errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the performance testing pipeline to have all required dependencies, so that load testing can execute successfully in the CI environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the performance test job runs THEN k6 SHALL be properly installed and available
2. WHEN load tests execute THEN the test files SHALL exist and be properly configured
3. WHEN the docker-compose environment starts THEN all required services SHALL be available for testing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper database migration and seeding scripts, so that the CI environment can be set up consistently for testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrate:reset is called THEN it SHALL reset the database schema using Prisma
2. WHEN db:seed is called THEN it SHALL populate the database with test data using existing seed scripts
3. WHEN database operations run in CI THEN they SHALL complete successfully with proper error handling
4. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL have access to a properly seeded test database

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CD pipeline to deploy successfully, so that new features can be released to staging and production environments reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CD workflow runs THEN all Kubernetes manifest files SHALL exist and be valid
2. WHEN Docker images are built THEN they SHALL use consistent tagging and registry configurations
3. WHEN deployments execute THEN health checks SHALL verify successful deployment
4. WHEN rollbacks are triggered THEN they SHALL restore the previous working version successfully
